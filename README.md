# Simusic

An agent-based algorithmic composition/accompaniment system

IMPORTANT:
-   The folder ./lib contains ONLY open-source
    packages whose license allows use and copy
    for non-commercial purposes.
-   The folder ./resources contains images from
    the website http://tech-kid.com/ - the authors
	claim that "we do not own the copyright to 
	any of the images on this website they are 
	provided as-is".
-   The folder ./runtime contains a folder
    /sample_agents used by the automatic agent
	creator tool which extracts all subdirectories
	of a selected folder as new agents. The sub-
	directories should contain the MIDI file 
	repertoire of each agent.
    The agent subdirectories contain MIDI 
	files which are freely available to
	download from many online sources.
	./runtime also contains the simusic.policy 
	file used by Java RMI to grant the code
	full RMI access permissions - this is safe
	because in this project all classes are local
	and trusted.
	
	

This is the live repository of Simusic - the
proposed agent-based algorithmic composition/
accompaniment system as part of fulfilling a
BSc Computing Science Honours degree at
University of Aberdeen (1 May 2015).
